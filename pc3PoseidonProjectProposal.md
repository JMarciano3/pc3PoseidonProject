<p align="left"><b> PROJECT PROPOSAL: </b></p>

Team Poseidon's project program called the Restaurant Receipt Point of Sale System is intended to make ordering and paying for food in restaurants easier. Customers will be able to place orders electronically, and the system will produce a thorough receipt that includes the customer's name, the quantity of items purchased, the menu, the date and time of the purchase, the tax, and the total amount of the payment. Customers will be able to place orders and view prices by using the system, which will be integrated with the restaurant's menu. Taxes will be automatically calculated by the software and added to the order as well. The interface will also enable the server to input the customer's name, view the items they ordered, and print a receipt.
