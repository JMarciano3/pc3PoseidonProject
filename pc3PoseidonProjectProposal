<p align="left"><b> PROJECT DETAILS: </b></p>

Team Poseidon's project program called the Restaurant Receipt Point of Sale System is intended to make ordering and paying for food in restaurants easier. Customers will be able to place orders electronically, and the system will produce a thorough receipt that includes the customer's name, the quantity of items purchased, the menu, the date and time of the purchase, the tax, and the total amount of the payment.
